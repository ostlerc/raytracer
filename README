Week 4:
I have added attenuation to the refractions
fixed some bugs with box collisions
added a BVH struture that speeds up things pretty well. one test I had was the low res bunny scene, this took 70 seconds without the BVH but only 6 seconds with it.

Future things:
  import ply files
  others listen in todo.txt

  Time is running out, i'm hoping I can get a lot of the ideas done with the path tracing. But so far I havn't had time to make the leap for path tracing.
