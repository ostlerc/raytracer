Raytracer:

usage: ./specter <scene>

sample scenes in the scenes directory.

features:
  planes, sphere, polarsphere, triangles, disc, ring and box primitives
  lambertian, specular, dielectric, metal, perlin noise, textured materials
  pinpoint camera, solid background, ply model parsing, ppm file reading and output
  animation available for all primitives, materials and cameras.
  BVH structure for high object count optimization.
  good scene structure with define-able materials for easy re-use. There is no documentation right now on what the scene format is. I would use the examples and look at Parser.cc for help creating new scenes.

missing:
   path tracing, color bleeding , soft shadows, indirect lighting, motion blur, caustics, photon mapping
