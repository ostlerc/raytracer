image to texture mapping
color bleeding ?
camera move
dieletrics
anti-aliasing (sampling)
bounding box optimizations
import models
some new scenes
checkered
get rid of shadow rays
perlin noise
motion blur
depth of field
indirect lighting ?
soft shadows

#my ideas
hierarchical modeling (rotation, translation, scaling)
global scaling
soft shadows
glossy reflection

intersection solids
high dynamic range image ?
intense language for scene ?
nerves
volume costic ? beams of light through dusty room
physics based renderer
bands of light
cone tracing ?

triangles [done]
specular [done]
reflections [done]
animations + ffmpeg movie [done]

threaded (meh?)
orthogonal camera (meh?)
