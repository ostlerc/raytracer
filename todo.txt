image to texture mapping
color bleeding
bounding box optimizations
import models
some new scenes
checkered
get rid of shadow rays
perlin noise
motion blur
depth of field
indirect lighting ?
soft shadows
glossy reflection (jitter reflected rays or normal)

#my ideas
hierarchical modeling (rotation, translation, scaling)
global scaling
fog

intersection solids (like death star)
high dynamic range image ?
intense language for scene ?
nerves
volume costic ? beams of light through dusty room
physics based renderer
bands of light
cone tracing ?

orthogonal camera (meh?)

triangles [done]
box primitive [done]
disc primitive [done]
ring primitive [done]
specular [done]
reflections [done]
animations + ffmpeg movie [done]
camera move [done]
threaded [done]
anti-aliasing (sampling) [done, could be extracted into a class]
dieletrics [done maybe with a bug?]
