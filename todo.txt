caustics [4] + [4]
depth of field [2]
motion blur [2]
bvh + dragon [6]



color bleeding (tracing?)
bounding box optimizations
some new scenes
get rid of shadow rays
motion blur
depth of field
indirect lighting ?
soft shadows
glossy reflection (jitter reflected rays or normal)
caustic

#my ideas
hierarchical modeling (rotation, translation, scaling)
global scaling
fog

intersection solids (like death star)
high dynamic range image ?
intense language for scene ?
nerves
volume costic ? beams of light through dusty room
physics based renderer
bands of light
cone tracing ?
photon mapping
orthogonal camera (meh?)
